# CHAT-APP
This is a Basic chat application using Node JS, Express JS with MongoDB Atlas as backend. 
I used Mongoose for creating the MongoDB models and Socket.io for making multidirectional chats on multiple client windows.
Make sure you have node.js installed and create a new package.json and re install all dependencies. Change the MongoDB URI to your URI and password.
